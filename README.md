# DigitalPrototyping_Module1
First module of Digital Prototpying seminar of the MDEF course. We worked to create and lasercut a mold and then use this mold with the creation of a biomaterial. Look below for the files and description of the process.

# Defining the Goals
Once we heard of the modules deliverable, creating a biomaterial and then using a lasercutter to cut pieces that can then be fitted together to create a structure, my partner (Manuja) and I deicded to talk a bit about what we wanted to achieve with this challenge. We decided that we want to play around bt still try and make a final product that has a purpose. with this in mind we knew that there were a few things to consider when making our material:

1. The material needed to be rigid enough to stand up straight without bending
2. The product should have and easy design and snap together
3. The material should be lightly heat resistant in case some heat is emmitted from light bulb

Now that our main objective were defined we set out to create some samples of materials.

# Sampling the Biomaterials

We originally thought we would make a huge batch of the material in one go and then cut it all, however there was an important step we almost missed. We needed to test our materials for there resistance to the lasercutter and the properties we wanted it to have. This is why we first made various samples to try out before making the final materials.

**1.Agar-Agar+Wool**
After talking to Petra we learned that we should add another fibourous component to give it a better structure integrity this is why wool fibers were added to the base using agar agar. 

The recipe we followed was a hot recipe meaning that the mixture was heated over heat and then poured into the mold. The ingredients are as followed:
* XXXX
* XXXX

**2.Gelatine+Hair+Color**
Another sample we tried to make was also agar-agar based but to this one we added goat hair and at a lesser amount so that the material might look a bit cleaner then the first sample. 

This recipe was also a hot recipe and the ingredients used are:
*XXX
*XXX

After testing some different options it was determined that the sample with gelatine and hair was the most viable optio for us to continue with. 

# Large Scale Pouring

 **First Try**
 After having a positive result from the first sample we decided
