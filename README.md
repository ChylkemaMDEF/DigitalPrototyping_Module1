# DigitalPrototyping_Module1
First module of Digital Prototpying seminar of the MDEF course. We worked to create and lasercut a mold and then use this mold with the creation of a biomaterial. Look below for the files and description of the process.

# Defining the Goals
Once we heard of the modules deliverable, creating a biomaterial and then using a lasercutter to cut pieces that can then be fitted together to create a structure, my partner (Manuja) and I deicded to talk a bit about what we wanted to achieve with this challenge. We decided that we want to play around bt still try and make a final product that has a purpose. with this in mind we knew that there were a few things to consider when making our material:

1. The material needed to be rigid enough to stand up straight without bending
2. The product should have and easy design and snap together
3. The material should be lightly heat resistant in case some heat is emmitted from light bulb

Now that our main objective were defined we set out to create some samples of materials.

# Sampling the Biomaterials

We originally thought we would make a huge batch of the material in one go and then cut it all, however there was an important step we almost missed. We needed to test our materials for there resistance to the lasercutter and the properties we wanted it to have. This is why we first made various samples to try out before making the final materials.

**1.Gelatine+Wool**
After talking to Petra we learned that we should add another fibourous component to give it a better structure integrity this is why wool fibers were added to the base using agar agar. 

The recipe we followed was a hot recipe meaning that the mixture was heated over heat and then poured into the mold. The ingredients are as followed:
- Water 240ml
- Gelatine 48 g
- Glycerol 0 g - for a rigid effect
- Wool - to ensure it stays together

Steps:
1. Heat water on stove and add powdered gelatin
2. Continue heating untill almost boiling, let all the gelatine disolve
3. Add glycerol now if you are using it
4. Lay wool on your mold, your mold should be acryllic or hard plastic when using gelatine
5. Allow mixture to cool slightly and then pour into mold
6. Let dry for around 2 days at room temperature

**2.Gelatine+Hair+Color**
Another sample we tried to make was also agar-agar based but to this one we added goat hair and at a lesser amount so that the material might look a bit cleaner then the first sample. 

This recipe was also a hot recipe and the ingredients used are:
*Water 240ml
*Gelatine 48 g
*Glycerol 0 g - for a rigid effect
*Goats hair - to ensure it stays together
*Myca powder red - add whatever type of colouring agent you want

Steps:
1. Heat water on stove and add powdered gelatin
2. Continue heating untill almost boiling, let all the gelatine disolve
3. Add glycerol and myca powder now
4. Lay hair on your mold, your mold should be acryllic or hard plastic when using gelatine
5. Allow mixture to cool slightly and then pour into mold
6. Let dry for around 2 days at room temperature

After testing some different options it was determined that the sample with gelatine and hair was the most viable optio for us to continue with. 

# Large Scale Pouring

 **First Try**
 After having a positive result from the first sample we decided to make a big batch, of the gelatine and hair recipe that had the structure we required, that we could then use to lasercut all the needed parts for the final model. However, sadly when we came in the day after the pour it turne out that the material lifted on one side. We determined that this could be due to a few different reasons, the first being that the pour was on the thinner size so it ended up drying quite quickly which could have caused the lift seen. Next to that there might be just not enough glycerin with maeks the material rigid and more prone to breakage.

**Second Try**
After the first big batch failed we talked to Petra, the local Fablab expert, and realized that the breakage and bubbling of the mixture could have been caused by 2 factors. First was the use of no glycerol, to combat that we needed to use an oil in the mixture to give it a better chance. We also chose to add a minimal amount of glycerol just in case. The other reason was that the material might haev been dried to quickly. With this in mind we decided to cover the molds so that the airflow would be minimal in the first 2 days and then take the covers off so it would dry evener. We also chose to make two circular molds that we could then use for the base and top of the lamp and then divide the larger mold in 2 so that we could lessen the amount of wastage of material.
